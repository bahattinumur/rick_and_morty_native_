<h1>RICK AND MORTY APP</h1>

I developed a React Native application Rick and Marty. This application displays characters from the Rick and Morty series and allows users to filter characters by gender (Male, Female, Genderless, Unknown) and status (Alive, Dead, Unknown). The data is retrieved from www.rickandmortyapi.com/api/. The project uses libraries such as @react-navigation, axios, redux, and react-redux, resulting in a simple yet functional application.
